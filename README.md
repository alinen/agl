A graphics library. Small, easy to use C++ library for 3D drawing, based on openGL.

## About

The goal of this project is to create an api that makes it easy to write 3D graphics demos in C++. This library supports my teaching and research (and so the api still changes frequently!). The design goals behind the api are:

* To make common tasks easy, e.g. drawing primitives, loading textures, defining shaders
* To make less common tasks possible
* To support fast prototyping and experimentation
